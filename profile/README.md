Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

We're a small development team that builds content management systems. Think of us as the folks who make it easier for people to manage their websites without pulling their hair out.

## What we're working on

**PteroCMS** - Our main project. It's a Laravel-based CMS that actually makes sense to use and develop with. We built it using modular architecture because we got tired of monolithic systems that become impossible to maintain.

## Why the name?

Pterodactyls were pretty good at adapting and surviving. We figured that's a good approach for software too - build things that can evolve and last.

## Our approach

- Keep it simple, but not simplistic
- Make it work for developers first
- Build with Laravel because it's solid
- Use modules so you can actually extend things
- Write documentation that people can understand

## Current status

We're actively developing PteroCMS and eating our own dog food (using it for real projects). It's getting better every day.
